# stock-predictor
I coded this in jupyter notebook and this code will allow you to input any ticker an it will use yahoo finance to see that stocks last price, volume, high's, low's, and make a probability on how likely it would be to go up or down. As of right now this code has TIKR "SPY". (Not financial advice)
